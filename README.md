# The List Of Tasks

The List Of Tasks is service that allows users to create, manage, and use To-Do lists!

This project was made with the goal of getting a feel in creating fullstack applications.

The backend uses **FastAPI + Async SQLAlchemy** (with PostgreSQL), while the frontend is made on **React + TS**.
